Vitals Tracker is an Android app designed to help users log and track their vital health statistics efficiently. The app includes an automated reminder system that notifies users every 5 hours to update their vitals, ensuring they stay on top of their health.

 **Automated Reminders** â€“ A notification is sent every 5 hours using WorkManager.  
 **Direct Navigation** â€“ Clicking the notification opens the logging screen directly.  
 **Jetpack Compose UI** â€“ Modern, declarative UI for a seamless experience.  
 **Local Data Storage** â€“ All vitals are saved using Room Database for offline access.  
 **Background Task Execution** â€“ WorkManager ensures notifications run even if the app is closed.  
 **Dependency Injection** â€“ Hilt is used to manage dependencies efficiently.  
 **Coroutines & Flow** â€“ Ensures smooth, asynchronous operations.

##  How It Works  

1. **Vitals Logging:** Users can enter their vital statistics in a structured format.  
2. **Background Reminders:** The app uses WorkManager to schedule periodic reminders every 5 hours.  
3. **Notification Handling:** When the user taps the notification, the app opens directly to the logging screen.  
4. **Data Storage:** Vitals are stored locally using Room Database for easy retrieval and offline access.  
5. **App Lifecycle Resilience:** WorkManager ensures reminders persist even after the app is closed or the device is restarted.
